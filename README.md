# Mastermind in Ruby

My ruby command line version of the classic code breaking game Mastermind!
<br>
The goal is to find the 4 digits code (composed of numbers from 0 to 6) in less than 12 tries.
<br>
You get feedback : X = right number, right location || O = right number, wrong location
<br>
<br>
This is one of my first Ruby programs built as part of the Odin Project.

## Usage 

To run this locally, clone the repo and simply run in the terminal:
<br>
<br>
`$ ruby mastermind.rb`
<br>
